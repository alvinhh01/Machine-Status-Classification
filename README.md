**Summary of Assignment Requirements:**

The regression task required students to apply supervised learning techniques to predict continuous numerical values. The goal was to explore and understand the use of regression models through practical application, interpretation of results, and clear documentation.

**Project Description:**

This regression task focuses on predicting a continuous target variable using features from a given dataset. Students explored linear regression and advanced models like decision tree regression, random forest, and gradient boosting. The project emphasizes understanding residuals, model fit, and performance metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².

**Machine Learning Workflow:**

1. Data Preprocessing: Feature selection, normalization, and handling of missing values.

2. Model Training: Building multiple regression models using Scikit-learn.

3. Model Evaluation: Assessing models using error metrics and visual inspection of residuals.

4. Insights and Interpretation: Drawing conclusions from model results to understand predictive patterns.

**PowerPoint Presentation:**
Slides summarize the methodology, key visualizations, model comparisons, and overall insights gained from the regression analysis.

**Outcome** 

Generated a model that has a 

1. **AUC (Area Under Curve): 0.994 (3.d.p)**
